<h2 id="head2"> Motivation of the project</h2>
In television series Bones, forensic anthropologist, Dr. Temperance "Bones" Brennanâ€™s ability to predict a number of qualities of a person just by examining bone X-rays, captured my imagination. So when I came across a bones dataset in Kaggle I decided to apply my newly acquired skills in Deep Neural Networks.

<h2 id="head3"> Instructions </h2>

1. Specify the path for image folders and csv file with gender and bone age information. Run the cells in BoneAge_DataProcessing notebook to save extracted features as npz files.

2. Run the cells in BoneAge_Prediction notebook to train a Convolution Neural Network and predict the ages of test images. The final predictions are saved as a CSV file.

<h2 id="head4"> Summary of the results </h2>

For test images, the predicted ages have a Mean Absolute Difference of 11.33. Below is a chart showing the actual and predicted ages.
